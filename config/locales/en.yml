Castoff at heel and toe will be adjusted.  After those procedures are done, we will shoot it on the pattern board.  After we shoot on the pattern board then the drop will be adjusted per customers point of impact desires."
  gun_fitting_text6_html: "Length of Pull - is the distance between the trigger and the center of the gun butt.  On doubles, the distance is measured from front trigger.<br>
  Pitch - is the angle of the butt in relation to top of barrel.  Pitch is important because you want 100% of the butt to fit snugly in shoulder pocket.<br>
  Cast - is the distance the centerline of stock is offset to one side or another of the centerline of the barrel.<br>
  Drop - is the distance from top of the barrel or rib to the top edge of stock at the comb and heel.  Drop is measured both at the comb and heel."
